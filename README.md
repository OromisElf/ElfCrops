# ElfCrops
 New exciting things to grow in Cataclysm: dda. Was meant to be resource crops but apparently some people want more plants so why not
 
 Plant Crops let you grow brown rice (which can then processed into dried rice), tinder and poppies. It is somewhat balanced.. I think.
 Resource Crops lets you grow things like ammo, cbms, planks or batteries. It is not balanced. Not even in the slightest. (pls don't send me threats)
